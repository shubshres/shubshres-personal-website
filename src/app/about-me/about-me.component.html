            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Shubhayu Shrestha and I am currently attending the University of Texas at Austin pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science. I graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington in December 2022 where I studied Software Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I formerly worked as a Full Stack Engineer at Fidelity Investments and have worked as a Full Stack Engineer Intern at Lockheed Martin and as an Undergraduate Researcher at UTA's Heracleia lab.
            </p>
            <p>
                 I have a strong passion for development, problem solving, game development, and UI/UX design and I love being able to apply those skills on large scale projects!
